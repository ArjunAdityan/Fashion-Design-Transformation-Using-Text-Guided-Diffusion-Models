# Fashion-Design-Transformation-Using-Text-Guided-Diffusion-Models
This repository contains the implementation of a novel approach for transforming fashion designs using text-guided diffusion models. The project combines LoRA-fine-tuned Stable Diffusion models with perceptual loss optimization to enable automated fashion design modifications while maintaining structural and stylistic integrity.
